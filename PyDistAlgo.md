## Stony Brook University Cybersecurity Lab

**Project description:** I participated as Lab Assistant in the Stony Brook University's Cybersecurity Lab. Self-studied the language PyDistAlgo, which is a high-level security protocol language programmed by SBU professors based on Python. I implemented several protocols based on the protocol logics from the [SPORE repository](http://www.lsv.fr/Software/spore/).
